# About Me

I'm an ex-management consultant turned data scientist. I graduated from Colgate University with a degree in Neuroscience and will complete my Master's in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley in December 2023.

# Interests

I'm interested in figuring out how to apply machine learning within contexts where it has traditionally not been exploited at scale. There is tremendous opportunity for machine learning models to disrupt sectors like finance, medicine, legal, and professional services industries.

When I'm not working or in class, I like to golf, ski, mountain bike, cook, and spend time with my family (including my dog).

# Recent Work

### [Classification of Direct- and Quasi-identifiers with Transformers](https://github.com/jvgalvin/nlp_ner)

Everyone has a right to privacy. Several data sets, however, remain locked to researchers because they contain direct- (i.e., full name) and quasi-identifiers (i.e., the combination of gender, birthdate, and zip code). Manual redaction of such data sets is costly and time-consuming. I fine-tuned a Longformer to identify direct- and quasi-identifiers in large court documents and beat a current state-of-the-art baseline. Such a model has applications across verticals as a method of preserving individuals' right to privacy and unlocking data sets for researchers that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

### [Image Recognition App with French Bulldogs](https://github.com/jvgalvin/Lucy_Classification_App)

I love French Bulldogs and am interested in computer vision. I fine-tuned ResNet50 to discriminate between images of my own Frenchie and images of other random Frenchies. I deployed this model as a web app using Flask.

### [Part 1 of 3: SQL and Functional Programming](https://github.com/jvgalvin/Portfolio/tree/main/query_functional_programming)

This is part 1 of a 3 part series of projects about a fictitious business. I wrapped SQL with Python to query a database filled with fictitious data about a meal delivery company and analyzed the results. The end deliverable is a series of recommendations to business leaders about how they can increase sales and implement a new customer model.

### [Part 2 of 3: User Activity Analytics](https://github.com/jvgalvin/Portfolio/tree/main/user_activity)

As a result of analysis from part 1, business leaders considered a third party delivery company to increase sales. They wanted to conduct a proof of concept to determine whether or not this made good business sense. I parsed third party sales data, merged it with the meal delivery company's proprietary data, and analyzed it to provide business leaders with recommendations about forming a relationship with the delivery company.

### [Part 3 of 3: Business Expansion Recommendations](https://github.com/jvgalvin/Portfolio/tree/main/business_expansion)

Business leaders wanted to expand, but realized that forming a relationship with another delivery company wouldn't be profitable. I analyzed alternative ways of delivering meals by representing our network of customers as a graph in Neo4j. I used graph centrality and community detection algorithms to identify which new delivery options would be profitable for the business.

### [Dinner and Drinks? Menu Planning App](https://github.com/jvgalvin/Portfolio/tree/main/Menu_Builder)

I love to cook and make cocktails ;). Sometimes, though, it's more work to figure out what to cook and shake than it is to whip them up! I created a program that recommends what to make based on the type of occasion or "mood" for the evening. 

### [Bitcoin Whales - When to Buy](https://github.com/jvgalvin/Portfolio/tree/main/Bitcoin_Whale_Analysis)

Bitcoin exploded a few years ago. Some people and organizations that hold an enormous share of the market, known as "whales," have the power to move the market based on their trading activity. I used an ensemble method to predict whether or not these whales would sell Bitcoin within the next 24 hours. Although I don't buy and sell Bitcoin myself, the idea is that this could be used to profit by shortselling Bitcoin.
